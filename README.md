# Digital Time Capsule

## Overview

Digital Time Capsule is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Solana blockchain that allows users to create, manage, and share time-locked digital capsules. These capsules can contain messages, images, and other digital content that are securely stored and can only be accessed at a predetermined future date.

## Features

- **Message and Image Storage**: Store text messages and image references securely on the Solana blockchain.
- **Time-based Access Control**: Set a future date for capsule opening, ensuring content remains private until then.
- **Multi-user Capsules**: Collaborate with friends to create shared memory capsules.
- **NFT Integration**: Each capsule is represented by a unique NFT, proving ownership and enabling potential trading.
- **Encrypted Content**: Securely encrypt capsule contents for privacy.
- **Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)**: Utilize PDAs for efficient capsule management and access.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main folders:

- `client/`: Contains the Next.js frontend application
- `contracts/`: Contains the Solana program written using Anchor

## System Architecture

Here's a high-level overview of the Digital Time Capsule system architecture:

## Technical Stack

- Solana Blockchain
- Rust (for Solana programs)
- Anchor Framework
- Next.js (for frontend)
- React.js
- Metaplex (for NFT functionality)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust and Cargo
- Solana CLI tools
- Node.js and npm
- Anchor Framework

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/digital-time-capsule.git
   cd digital-time-capsule
   ```

2. Install dependencies for the Solana program:
   ```
   cd contracts
   anchor build
   ```

3. Deploy the program to a Solana cluster (e.g., devnet):
   ```
   anchor deploy
   ```

4. Install dependencies for the frontend:
   ```
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

5. Start the frontend development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
