# User Stories for Digital Time Capsule

   1. As a user, I want to create a new time capsule so that I can store messages for the future.

   2. As a capsule creator, I want to set a future date for my capsule to be opened so that its contents remain secret until then.

   3. As a user, I want to upload images to my capsule so that I can preserve visual memories.

   4. As a capsule contributor, I want to invite friends to add content to my capsule so we can create shared memories.

   5. As a user, I want to encrypt the contents of my capsule so that only intended recipients can view them when opened.

   6. As a capsule owner, I want to receive an NFT representing my capsule so I can prove ownership and potentially trade it.

   7. As a user, I want to view a list of my created and contributed capsules so I can manage them easily.

   8. As a capsule recipient, I want to be notified when a capsule addressed to me is ready to be opened.

   9. As a user, I want to ensure my capsule contents are securely stored and cannot be tampered with.

   10. As a developer, I want to use PDAs to create deterministic addresses for capsules so they can be easily located and managed.
